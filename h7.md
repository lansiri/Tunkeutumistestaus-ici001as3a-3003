### 📝 X) Read and Summarize

Had some struggle to find an intresting new article related closely to course material, and passing JUFO level 1-3.

### PentHack: AI-Enabled Penetration Testing Platform for Knowledge Development

Vol. 23 No. 1 (2024): Proceedings of the 23rd European Conference on Cyber Warfare and Security

**Jufo: taso 1**

https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/eccws/article/view/2493

PDF: https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/eccws/article/view/2493/2104

The review article introduces an AI-enabled python application named PentHack. They tried several different LLMS until they decided to move forward with OpenAI:s GPT-4 API.

It combines LLM to a user-friendly GUI, reducing the complexity of learning pentesting with AI. It has built-in commands, to help getting started with pentesting and learning commands.

Screenshots of the app:

Overall, the article shows that learning pentesting can be greatly improved and accelerated with help of LLM:s.

### Bandit 12

"The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions"

![alt text](imagesh7/image-23.png)

### Bandit 13

"The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)"

*Times up, might continue later.*
